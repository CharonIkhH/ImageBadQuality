# ImageBadQuality SCRIPT by CharonIkh and Strydex
This script allows you to apply 10 different effects to any number of pictures/photos in less than 5 seconds, unlike the same actions in the built-in Photoshop script editor.


Guide for use.

1) Launch your VS Code or any other IDE 
2) Go to venv/Include/main.py 
3) Throw the images you need in the directory, canceled by the path: venv/undone 
4) Run the script in main.py
5) You create all the finished images in the Done file by the path: venv/done The number of images is unlimited, you can put an infinite number of photos in the undone folder, the script processes them all at once quickly, this method can be used to train machine review.

The script also automatically numbers the photos, which makes not necessary manual changes to the names and will not create any problems.
